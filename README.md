### Summary

In order to generate a sales report, I needed to visualise sales between a given date range. Hence, I decided to use a discrete bar graph rather than a time series so that we can compare values between dates. I also let the user choose a date range to display. This makes sense in a real life scenario as a company may not want to see their entire sales history in one graph, rather, they would more likely want to see a week or a month's worth of data.

After choosing a date range, there is an option to export the chart to your computer as an SVG file. This would no doubt make it easier to generate sales reports over a long period of time, and can be extended to be done automatically.

I had no prior experience with React before this challenge. Most of the time spent on this was reading documentation and online tutorials. I see myself using React in the future as I found it intuitive and rather enjoyable to use. I look forward to gaining more experience with React and using it for future data visualisation projects.

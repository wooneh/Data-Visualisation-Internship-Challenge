## Data Visualisation Internship Challenge
The following challenge simulates work you will be doing as the data visualisation intern. No prior knowledge of javascript, React, or Recharts is expected or necessary to complete this challenge.

Often on the job, you will be faced with new and completely unfamiliar technology. This challenge tests your ability to work in such conditions, and your ability to navigate documentation and API.

### Prerequisites
- Coding experience
- Basic competency with terminal and git


### Installation instructions
- Visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and install Node 
- You can confirm you have node installed by typing 'node -v' in the terminal and receiving a response of what verison is installed
- Navigate to the intern-task directory in terminal 
- 'npm install'
- 'npm start'
- Now you can open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to see the instructions for the task.

### Submission Instructions

Please create a public github repository with your code and email careers@quantiful.co.nz with the link and with 'Data Visualisation Challenge Response' as the email subject.

### Summary

In order to generate a sales report, I needed to visualise sales between a given date range. Hence, I decided to use a discrete bar graph rather than a time series so that we can compare values between dates. I also let the user choose a date range to display. This makes sense in a real life scenario as a company may not want to see their entire sales history in one graph, rather, they would more likely want to see a week or a month's worth of data.

After choosing a date range, there is an option to export the chart to your computer as an SVG file. This would no doubt make it easier to generate sales reports over a long period of time, and can be extended to be done automatically.

I had no prior experience with React before this challenge. Most of the time spent on this was reading documentation and online tutorials. I see myself using React in the future as I found it intuitive and rather enjoyable to use. I look forward to gaining more experience with React and using it for future data visualisation projects.
